  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>My name is Elena I started playing games in elementary school, just playing Pokemon with my brother and his friends. That jumpstarted my interest in technology and finding a community in gaming. My game of choice nowadays is League of Legends and have been playing for over 10 years (even playing 2 of those years competitively)!

I would have never ever thought that playing League of Legends would then propel me into the esports industry. High school me would never believe that in 4 years, she would have worked with legacy teams such as TSM, Evil Geniuses, and FaZe Clan. In my position now, I work with 20+ teams of all sizes and different points in their business journey.

Whether it is improving digital strategy or finding the most compelling data for reports, I utilize my experience as a CSM and gamer to assist with various types of marketing, partnership, and reporting needs. 

It is always a challenge to find out where value comes from in the esports industry. My mission is to use valuable data while personally working with esports teams, big or small, to adjust social media strategy and impact gaming communities.

By doing so, esports teams can get more resources in order to flourish: expand their brand and ultimately connect with their fanbase with an authentic voice that is true to their team.

I am very interested in research and data analytics so I am open to opportunities that will help me grow!</p>

  <h3>Gaming</h3>
  <p>Should I be ashamed of the fact I play video games?


You might have noticed (or not) that I changed my LinkedIn banner for the very first time. For those who play even a little bit of League of Legends knows what it is!

For those of you who don’t know what it is, let me break it down:

I achieved the Master rank in Solo/Duo. 
This game, has 180 million players, with its peak being more than 32 million daily players worldwide (numbers may vary but you get the gist). Achieving the Master rank means that you are in the top 0.1% of players in your region.

I maintain Honor Level 5.
The honor level is a system where other players on your team can give you a positive rating for your performance in the game you just played together. Honor level 5 is the highest anyone can achieve.

I won the Shurima Cup (Tier 1). 
In an 8 team bracket, we won first out of teams that were just as high quality as our own. Typically top 5% of players.

This post got a bit of attention on Twitter, when I had posted a screenshot of my updated profile on my personal account. 232K impressions, 2.5K likes in under 12 hours… highly unusual.

So of course, I had to analyze this situation and understand why the community was reacting so strongly to it. I observed and noted the comments made. I categorized 41 public comments:

20 positively responding to my decision
10 neutral responses to my decision 
4 negatively responding to my decision
6 !! about my honor level

I was particularly curious about the 4 responses because they echo the same sentiment: doesn’t belong on Linkedin/no one will hire you. Twitter is a breeding ground for toxic/trolls to come into the conversation, but this concept specifically was interesting.

I wanted to address this and start more conversations about it. Why would having an interest in gaming make someone not want to hire you? And especially, where does being a top tier gamer matter? I accrue social capital in the “gaming world” but how, if it even does, does it translate to a world where games and ranks don’t matter?

Being a gamer has transferable skills to the workplace, but not only that, I’ve found it to be one connection I’ve been able to make in all of my successful internships, jobs, and opportunities in my career. I’m not afraid to talk about my interests in games, but I used to be.

Having played League of Legends for over 10 years and achieving one of the highest ranks a person can get has changed how I view the game itself as well as the community.

I want to make it my mission to educate and teach people outside of the gaming world the value and importance of gaming skills.

If you get good at something, that is a testament to dedication and passion. I searched for my passion for so long, not knowing that it was right in front of me all along.

So is being a gamer a contentious identity? Is it an interest that is welcome in your workplace?
