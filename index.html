  <h3>Helloge</h3>
  <p>My name is Elena I started playing games in elementary school, just playing Pokemon with my brother and his friends. That jumpstarted my interest in technology and finding a community in gaming. My game of choice nowadays is League of Legends and have been playing for over 10 years (even playing 2 of those years competitively)!

I would have never ever thought that playing League of Legends would then propel me into the esports industry. High school me would never believe that in 4 years, she would have worked with legacy teams such as TSM, Evil Geniuses, and FaZe Clan. In my position now, I work with 20+ teams of all sizes and different points in their business journey.

<br> Whether it is improving digital strategy or finding the most compelling data for reports, I utilize my experience as a CSM and gamer to assist with various types of marketing, partnership, and reporting needs. 

It is always a challenge to find out where value comes from in the esports industry. 

    <br> My mission is to use valuable data while personally working with esports teams, big or small, to adjust social media strategy and impact gaming communities.

By doing so, esports teams can get more resources in order to flourish: expand their brand and ultimately connect with their fanbase with an authentic voice that is true to their team.

I am very interested in research and data analytics so I am open to opportunities that will help me grow!</p>
